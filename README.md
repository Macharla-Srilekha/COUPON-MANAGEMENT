# COUPON-MANAGEMENT
This project implements a simple coupon management system for an e-commerce platform using a RESTful HTTP service. It provides an API to create coupons with eligibility rules such as minimum cart value, user eligibility, and expiry date. Another API evaluates a given user and cart input to identify all applicable coupons.
